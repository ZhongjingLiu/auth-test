Static sites are turning into dynamic, rich experiences. Handling static forms, authentication, and backend functions on statically-generated sites is now a thing.

Especially with the JAMstack pioneer platform that is Netlify. Recently, they announced support of AWS Lambda functions on frontend-centric sites & apps. I've been meaning to dive into their "backend" features since.

Here, I'm doing just that, using a static Gatsby site and Netlify's Forms, Identity, and Functions features. 

Steps:

- Add static forms to your site
- Add user authentication for password-protected content
- Create an AWS Lambda function

Ready to supercharge a static site with serverless features?
